Hello and welcome to **remarkablegames**!

You might be wondering, "_Why create this site?_" I did it to scratch a personal itch. As a programmer who's into building products that are fun and delightful, I realize that games fit this bill. Funny enough, games is what got me into programming in the first place.

Also, my love for games intersects with my passion for education. If you think about it, games are one of the best mediums for learning (given that they're good). Games have rules, mechanics, and information conveyed within its world. If a game does its job correctly, it will teach the players mental models which can be used to identify problems and solve them. And the best thing of all? It's done under the pretense of fun so it doesn't actually feel like work.

Of course, not all games follow the same process or formula. Some games have goals (complete the objective) while others do not (explore open world). But they all provide a means for the player to interact and _seemingly_ influence the environment. What differentiates a book from a game is that the former is a passive act of imagination whereas the latter is an active act of creating a narrative. Ultimately, it's the act of self-expression that makes us feel alive and in control. Games are a metaphor for the truth we seek in real-life.

So my plan is to use this site as a place to document my journey, lessons, thoughts, and ideas on game development. And I hope you will join me too. =)
