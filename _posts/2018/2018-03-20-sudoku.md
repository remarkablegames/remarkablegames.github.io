[Sudoku](https://remarkablegames.org/sudoku/) is out!

Here's a description of Sudoku from [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku):

> Sudoku (a.k.a. Number Place) is a logic-based, combinatorial number placement puzzle.
> The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

## Algorithm

Generating a Sudoku puzzle/solution turned out to be harder than expected. Like [Tile Matcher]({% post_url 2018/2018-01-13-tile-matcher %}), the shape of the puzzle/solution is a [multi-dimensional array](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_type#Multi-dimensional_arrays).

```js
// 9x9 grid
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
  [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3],
  [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1],
  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4],
  [8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
  [6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  [9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
  [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2]
]
```

I saw that many other algorithms backtracked by solving the puzzle. The algorithm I hacked together in [repl.it](https://repl.it/@remarkablemark/Sudoku-Solution-Generator), on the other hand, attempted to generate each row randomly and checked if the solution was valid.

My algorithm wasn't perfect because sometimes an infinite loop would occur (see line 110). Moreover, it could generate puzzles that aren't unique (has more than 1 solution).

## UI

Like [Tile Matcher]({% post_url 2018/2018-01-13-tile-matcher %}), the user interface (UI) is event-driven which meant that I was able to use [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact). The [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/remarkablemark/e9abgq6d/) came quickly after.

<script async src="//jsfiddle.net/remarkablemark/e9abgq6d/embed/result,js,css,html/"></script>

I built the grid using semantic HTML5 elements like [table](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics) and [inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input). Consequently, I got [tabbing navigation](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbing_navigation) for free. I then implemented arrow key navigation to make it even more accessible for keyboard users.

```html
<table>
  <tbody>
    <!-- rows -->
    <tr>
      <!-- columns -->
      <td>
        <input value="1" />
      </td>
      ...
    </tr>
    ...
  </tbody>
</table>
```
