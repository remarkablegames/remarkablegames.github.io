## Background

The game was made for the [Rhythm Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/rhythm-jam-2024), which the theme was `Divergence`:

> a difference between two or more things, attitudes, or opinions.

We brainstormed on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=4xsd2WQeFiejrdBQkalCR,GLv9eoVsLsWhkXYKI1gCLA) and were inspired by [Friday Night Funkin'](https://friday-nightfunkin.io/) and [Guitar Hero](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero).

The [proof of concept](https://replit.com/@remarkablemark/Rhythm-Game) showed that it was possible to make a rhythm game in [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/). We then worked on the [MVP](https://replit.com/@remarkablemark/Rhythm-Jam-2024) before finishing it up on [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkablegames/rhythmism).
