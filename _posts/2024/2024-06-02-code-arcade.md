## Play

Play the game on:

- [remarkablegames](https://remarkablegames.org/code-arcade/)
- [itch.io](https://remarkablegames.itch.io/code-arcade)
- [newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/934247)

## Background

I joined the [GameDev.tv Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-jam-2024), but the theme was `Last Stand` and I decided not to use it.

I wanted to create a game that could teach programming fundamentals‚Äîsomething like [Untrusted](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/) but more beginner-friendly.

I chose [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) as the game engine because:

1. the [API](https://kaboomjs.com/#add) is easy-to-use and learn
2. the library has a [flexible component system](https://blog.replit.com/kaboom)
3. the functions are injected into the global namespace

I created a prototype in [Replit](https://replit.com/@remarkablemark/Code-Arcade) where I rendered a [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) editor next to a game canvas. I added a button to "Run" the code from the editor.

But because the game keeps rendering in the same `window`, the game starts lagging after a few playthroughs due to memory leaks.

So I moved the code to [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkablegames/code-arcade) and refactored the game to render inside an [inline iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#srcdoc) to fix the performance issues.

I then added 20+ levels and playtested it with a bunch of people. I iterated on their feedback and adjusted the level difficulty and added hints.

Finally, I submitted the game to the game jam. Let me know what you think!
