## Background

We joined [Safe In Our World Mental Health Game Dev Champions 2024](https://itch.io/jam/mental-health-game-dev-champions-2024) and the theme of the game jam was on `mental health`.

We brainstormed in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=fZsGhoV7_qbCx1CrTdl5w,RfNwdGpO82BLKXXnkH3MiQ) and we were inspired by games like [Persona](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(series)>). We decided to make a visual novel centered around a student attending a psychology class with a surprise and lesson at the end.

We created a game design document and wrote the dialogue for the ending act. We then added the beginning and middle acts.

We chose [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) as the game engine because it's a popular visual novel engine that's free. This was our first time using Ren'Py and the scripting language was super easy to use. To streamline the build and release of the game to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [itch.io](https://itch.io/), I created a GitHub Action workflow [setup-renpy]({% post_url 2024/2024-06-10-setup-renpy-cli-github-actions %}).

We submitted the game to several game jams to get feedback. The game is also open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkablegames/psych-101). Let me know what you think!
