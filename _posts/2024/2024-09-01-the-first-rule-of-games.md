If you're making a game, the first rule is that it has to be **fun**. If it's not fun, then people won't play it.

Players might say they like a game's art, story, dialogue, audio, and/or character design, but what engages them is the **gameplay**. Everything else only complements. You can have a game with minimal aesthetics and yet the game can still be fun.

If people say, "_It's boring_," "_It feels like a chore_," or "_I don't see the point_," then you need to reevaluate your game immediately. Because if you don't have the core game mechancis down, then it's a waste of your time to continue to polish the game.

A wise man once said, "_A brilliant solution to the wrong problem can be worse than no solution at all._"
