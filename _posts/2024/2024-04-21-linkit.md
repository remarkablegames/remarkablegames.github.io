## Background

This game was made for [Gamedev.js Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2024), which the theme was `power`.

We brainstormed on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=kdRfqSm9UoL0cEQ8MPRNo,mMrxHx-OPwRogYySd-1PqQ) and came up with the following ideas:

1. Clicker game
2. Power tycoon simulator
3. Electric circuit puzzle

We tried to build a power tycoon simulator but realized it was going to take too much time. We then looked into the electric circuit puzzle and decided to go down that route.

We created a proof of concept on [Replit](https://replit.com/@remarkablemark/Linkit) and decided to keep the minimal design. After adding a few levels, we moved the code over to [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkablegames/linkit).

The way the game works is that a line is drawn connecting a pair of colored dots. The puzzle is completed when all pairs of colored dots are connected without intersecting lines.

To make the levels harder, we added more colored pairs and increased the grid size.

We opted into the following challenges:

- [Open Source by GitHub](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2024/#challenge-opensource)
- [Build it with Phaser by Phaser Studio](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2024/#challenge-phaser)
