## Play

Play the game on:

- [remarkablegames](https://remarkablegames.org/secret-identity)
- [itch.io](https://remarkablegames.itch.io/secret-identity)

## Background

This game was made for [Game Off 2024](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024), which the theme was **SECRETS**.

I wanted to make a game similar to 21 questions except you play against an AI chatbot.

I generated the project from [remarkablemark/vite-preact-tailwind-ai-template](https://github.com/remarkablemark/vite-preact-tailwind-ai-template), which uses the technology:

- [Cloudflare AI](https://ai.cloudflare.com/)
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

Check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkablegames/secret-identity) and let me know what you think!
