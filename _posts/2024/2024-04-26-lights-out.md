## Play

Play the game:

- [remarkablegames](https://remarkablegames.org/lights-out/)
- [Itch.io](https://remarkablegames.itch.io/lights-out)

## Background

This game was made for [Gamedev.js Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2024), which the theme was `power`.

We ideated on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=kdRfqSm9UoL0cEQ8MPRNo,mMrxHx-OPwRogYySd-1PqQ) and used the [phaser-rpg](https://github.com/remarkablegames/phaser-rpg) template.

We added different elements to see what sticks:

- AI character (spaceman)
- Drawing rocks with the mouse
- Vignette FX with the camera

In the end, the goal was for the player to collect the "powerups" (spacemen). The obstacle was the fog of war that increased over time.

We opted into the following challenges:

- [Open Source by GitHub](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2024/#challenge-opensource)
- [Build it with Phaser by Phaser Studio](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2024/#challenge-phaser)
