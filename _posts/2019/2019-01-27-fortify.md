## Overview

The puzzle game was developed during the [Global Game Jam 2019 (GGJ)](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/news/theme-global-game-jam-2019-%E2%80%A6) in which the theme was:

> **What home means to you**

We chose [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) as the game framework and [matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) as the physics engine. As a result, we made the decision to scaffold the project from [phaser-template](https://github.com/remarkablegames/phaser-template).

The game mechanics were inspired by a [matter.js example](https://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src\physics\matterjs\advanced%20shape%20creation.js) found in [Phaser Labs](https://labs.phaser.io/).

Our goals when building the game were to keep it _**accessible**_, _**responsive**_, and _**intuitive**_ (you may realize that there are no instructions).

We tried to keep the game as simple as possible. (The only way to interact with the world is through _clicking_ or _tapping_.) Currently, there are only 3 levels.

Improvements that can be made are:

- making the physics better,
- integrating sound,
- enhancing the gameplay,
- adding transitions and animations,
- and improving the UI.

Nevertheless, we had a blast creating the game. We're grateful to all the playtesters who stopped by to play the game during the showcase. It warmed our hearts to hear that our game was "_fun_" and "_addicting_."

Overall, this turned out to be an amazing game jam and I want to thank the folks who made it all possible.
