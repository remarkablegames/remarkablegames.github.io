[Fortify](https://b.remarkabl.org/fortify) is out!

> The version referenced in this article is [v0.3.0](https://github.com/remarkablegames/fortify/tree/v0.3.0)

The puzzle game was developed during the 2019 [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) (GGJ). The theme was `home`.

We chose [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) as our game framework and [matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/) as our physics engine. As a result, we scaffolded our game from [phaser-template](https://github.com/remarkablegames/phaser-template).

The game mechanics was inspired by a [matter.js example](https://labs.phaser.io/view.html?src=src\physics\matterjs\advanced%20shape%20creation.js) found in [Phaser Labs](https://labs.phaser.io/).

When building the game, we intentionally sought to make it _**accessible**_, _**responsive**_, and _**intuitive**_ (no instructions included).

We tried to keep the game as simple as possible. (The only way to interact with the world is through _clicking_ or _tapping_.) Currently, there are 3 levels.

The improvements that can be made are:

- making the physics better,
- integrating sound,
- enhancing the gameplay,
- adding transitions and animations,
- and improving the UI.

Overall, we had a blast creating the game. We'd like to thank all the playtesters that stopped by to play the game during the showcase. It warmed our hearts to hear that our game was "_fun_" or "_addicting_."

This was indeed a successful game jam!
