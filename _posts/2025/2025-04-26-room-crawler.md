## Background

This game was made for [Gamedev.js Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2025), which the theme was `Balance`.

I bootstrapped the game from [renpy-rpg](https://github.com/remarkablegames/renpy-rpg) so that I could make a point-and-click, turn-based combat.

[Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) is a visual novel engine, but I was able to borrow mechanics from my previous games [Built to Scale]({% post_url 2024/2024-08-20-built-to-scale %}) and [Haunted Heir]({% post_url 2024/2024-09-16-haunted-heir %}).

To make the RPG system work, I created classes for the player and enemy characters. I also added RNG (random number generation) to the stats, skills, and rewards. The shop interface gives the player choices about the economy and I added an exploration mechanic to fit with the roguelike theme.

Ultimately, I created 10 levels, where you face between 1 to 3 enemies. After beating the game, you can choose to continue playing with randomly generated enemies.

The game is open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkablegames/room-crawler). Let me know what you think!
