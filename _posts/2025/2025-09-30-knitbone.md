> You play as Eden Cross, who suffers from chronic insomnia, feeling disconnected from your life. One day, an old college acquaintance ‚Äì Ryohei shows up pitching a miracle cure for your insomnia: an ‚Äúexperimental therapy.‚Äù
>
> That sounds suspiciously more like what he also calls it ... a ‚Äúguided ritual.‚Äù
