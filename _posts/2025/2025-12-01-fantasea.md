## Background

This game was made for [GitHub Game Off 2025](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2025), which the theme was **WAVES**.

I collaborated with [Wavend](https://wavendart.itch.io/), who created the art, and [Michael Kalra](https://earentech.itch.io/), who composed the music.

During ideation, we wanted to make a tower defense game with influences from [Dispatch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/). Inspired by the theme, we had a concept where fantasy characters battled medieval monsters at the beach. So the tagline became _"Heroes on vacation, but the monsters crash the beach party."_

[Wavend](https://wavendart.itch.io/) sketched some really nice concept art that combined medieval characters with pool party theme:

- Guard (combination of knight and lifeguard)
- Witch (mage who throws beach balls)
- Archer (shoots ~~seashells~~ arrows)
- Goblin (monster in a lifebuoy)
- Slime (monster in a lifebuoy)
- Orc (monster in a lifebuoy)

[Michael Kalra](https://earentech.itch.io/) produced the ambient background music. He composed an initial demo with waves and seagulls sounds. He used synth, pad, and saw instrumentals. He then mixed and mastered the track and added lo-fi drums. I was super impressed that he did it all under 1 week!

I chose [KAPLAY](https://kaplayjs.com/) as the game engine since it's very easy to prototype ideas. I bootstrapped the game from [kaplay-template](https://github.com/remarkablegames/kaplay-template).

I first built the foundation of the tower defense game. I then added levels and a reward/upgrade system that adds multipliers to your heroes' attacks (e.g., damage, speed, cooldown, etc.). By the end of the jam, I added 10 levels with a variety of bases, heroes, and monsters/bosses.

Let me know what you think of the game! You can find the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkablegames/fantasea).
