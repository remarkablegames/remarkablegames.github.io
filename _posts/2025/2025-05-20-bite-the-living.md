## Background

The game was made for [Pixel Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/-pixel-game-jam-2025), which the theme was **From the Dead**.

We ideated on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#json=eeiKPEwkUf2AauUocUiSH,5PfjhMuUElgs1RlALq52Dw) and decided to go with a reverse zombie game where you control zombies and attack humans (similar to [Infectonator](https://www.togeproductions.com/project/infectonator/)).

We chose [KAPLAY.js](https://kaplayjs.com/) as the game engine because prototyping is fast and it handles 2D pixel art. The game was bootstrapped from [`kaplay-template`](https://github.com/remarkablegames/kaplay-template).

We used the assets:

- [Zombie Apocalypse AssetPack](https://pixelrogueknight.itch.io/zombie-apocalypse-assetpack)
- [Free Horror Music Pack](https://void1gaming.itch.io/free-horror-music-pack)
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/)

We added the characters:

- Zombie
  - Spawns when Human dies
  - Loses health over time
  - Does damage when it collides with Human
- Fast Zombie
  - Spawns when Gunman dies
  - Shares similar properties as Zombie except it moves 1.5x faster
- Human
  - Moves away from zombie
- Gunman
  - Shares similar properties as Human except it doesn't move
  - Shoots at zombie every 3 seconds (with friendly fire)

The player can choose one of two rewards after each level (except the tutorial):

- Increase zombie speed
- Increase zombie health
- Increase zombie damage
- Increase zombie heal after beating a human
- Increase line of sight so zombie moves to human if it's within a distance

The game has 10 levels. The initial levels are tutorials for the controls and mechanics. The later levels required strategy to defeat humans with a horde of zombies.
