## Prologue

For the first track, I pitched the hi-hat to make a ticking sound since in the quiet of the night, sounds become more pronounced. I used a pad and low kick to create a dark ambience for the introductory track.

## Oasis

For the title track, I used saw synths, risers, and percussive elements to emulate the sound of waves. I used the Phrygian dominant scale to give it a desert-like vibe with melodic yet haunting vocals in the background. I wanted the track to build up and show the duality between fast versus slow, loud versus quiet, and high versus low tide.

## Epilogue

For the last track, I wanted to make something chill and ambient, like a boat sailing out in the night sky. I used pads, strings, and a wind sounds.
