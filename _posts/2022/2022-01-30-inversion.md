## Background

The game was made during the [Global Game Jam 2022](https://globalgamejam.org/2022/games/inversion-7), in which the theme was `duality`.

The original concept of the game was a split screen where you control a player on the left and a player on the right except the player on the right had inverted movements. The goal of the game was to move both players to a certain location in order to progress to the next level.

We ended up pivoting on a better idea where both players just collide in the same level in order to win.

The game was bootstapped from the [phaser-platformer](https://github.com/remarkablegames/phaser-platformer) template. We used [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) as the game engine and [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) as the map editor.

The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkablegames/inversion).
