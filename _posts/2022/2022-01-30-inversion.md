## Play

Play the game:

- [remarkablegames](https://remarkablegames.org/inversion/)
- [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/831514)
- [Itch.io](https://remarkablegames.itch.io/inversion)

## Background

The game was made for the [Global Game Jam 2022](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2022/games/inversion-7), in which the theme was `duality`.

The original concept of the game was a split screen where you control a player on the left and a player on the right with inverted movement. The goal of the game was to move both players to a certain location in order to progress to the next level.

We ended up pivoting to a better mechanic where both players have to collide in order to win.

The game was bootstrapped from [phaser-platformer](https://github.com/remarkablegames/phaser-platformer). We used [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) as the game engine and [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) as the map editor.

The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/remarkablegames/inversion).
